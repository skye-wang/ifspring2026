    <p>1. Skye, Senior studying CDes and minoring in HCI</p>
    <p>2. I'm from Chicago, and took this class to continue learning about websites and design!</p>
    <p>3. Pretty experienced, I've taken Web Dev + other UIUX classes as well</p>
    <p>4. One thing I want to focus on is the "why" when creating websites and making design decisions, and learn more on how to balance practicality/utility and aesthetics</p>
    <p>5. Definitely more technical compared with traditional mediums, and lots of additional considerations when creating an interactive web experience since the medium is through screens rather than physical</p>
    <p>6. <a href="apple.com">Apple</a></p>
    <p>I think Apple is just always a classic example of great design, it's clean, modern and embodies design principles to the max.</p>
    <p>7. <a href="youtube.com">Youtube</a></p>
    <p>I chose Youtube as an example of clearly communicating what it offers (videos and content) in an intuitive manner so that it's easy for any user to understand and consume</p>
    <p>8. <a href="https://goblin.tools">Goblin Tools</a></p>
    <p>I chose this because I love the ultra simplicity of this website, and that it's very intuitive.</p>
